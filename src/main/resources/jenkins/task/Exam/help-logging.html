<div>
    A log file is generated automatically during each test run. You can influence the amount of output that gets logged over the LogLevel. If you develop a test case or are looking for errors, you should set the LogLevel to DEBUG. In difficult cases you can choose INTERNAL. Since this option leads to a great amount of additional data in the LogFile, it should be used solely for bugfixing. The different loglevels work as follows: Number and level of detail of the output increases from top to bottom. An entry below another always includes the upper one's output.
